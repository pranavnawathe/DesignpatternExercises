- This is an example for Strategy design pattern in JAVA

- In this example, extraction system for 3 types of files is created, but incomplete.

- You need to fill in the '__________________' blanks to complete the code

- When you run it, the example will prompt for type of extraction needed, when entering correct type, for example, 'd', following lines will be printed on the console: 
Opening database file
I will extract by reading rows and columns
Closing database file

- Structure of the code is as follows: 
Extraction interface is implemented by concrete extraction classes such as csvExtraction, tsvExtraction and databaseExtraction
There are 3 types of data are defined - csv, tsv and database
when entered the preferred choice, extraction algorithm should be run 

- This exercise should be completed to reflect implementation of strategy design pattern
